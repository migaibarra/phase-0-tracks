## How to tackle jQuery
# Planned by Miguel A. Ibarra, Jr.

1. Read the Wikipedia article on jQuery

Doing the first item helped me understand the basics of what jQuery is (namely a special library of JavaScript methods). It also got me thinking of what is possible with jQuery.

2. Think of questions I may have on the jQuery

While reading up on jQuery in the Wikipedia article, I came up with some questions like "what is possible with using jQuery?" and "what are the more common functions that I can use using jQuery?"

3. Look up questions in Google

Google had plenty of information for me to look at with regards to jQuery and what I could accomplish. I especially liked some of the website templates that demonstrated the power of using jQuery.

4. While reading about some of the topics and problems with JQuery, also try some example code to solidify concepts

While reading the jQuery documentation it was especially helpful working through some of the examples that were given to me to try and solidify my understanding of jQuery and when it can be useful.
