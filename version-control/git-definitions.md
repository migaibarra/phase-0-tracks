# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* *Version control is a way to work on code using save points called commits whereby multiple versions of the same code may be worked simultaneously by multiple developers. This is useful because one person may add one feature and another person can add a different feature. The idea is to work on different branches and eventually cleanly (or sometimes not so cleanly) merge code together to form a final product.*
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* *A branch is a copy of the code that can be worked on by an individual developer. A branch allows us to work on code seperately without affecting the master in case there is an issue with that branch of code.*
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* *A commit is a save point for code. When you commit you are updating the files such that the repository will now have a certain file or new code added to it. When committing, it is important to have good descriptive commit messages to let others know what you did for that new save point for the code.*
* What is a merge conflict?
* *Merge conflicts arise when something happens when merging a part of code you are working on with a different branch making the files to not work as expected or even getting corrupted. Good messaging when committing can help deveopers track down bugs when a merge conflict does arise.*
