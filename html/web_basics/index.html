<h2>That's more like it!</h2>
<strong>That is a real cat!!!</strong>
<p>
	Things that I like about cats include the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are sneaky.</li>
	<li>They are too cute.</li>
	<li>They purr.</li>
	<li>They just make me laugh!</li>
</ul>
<p>Things that I don't like about cats:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are scratch.</li>
	<li>They sometimes ignore you.</li>
	<li>They sometimes are <em>just evil.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
	If I could get a cat (my apartment does allow them :( ) the following would be my top names for my cat:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Simba</li>
	<li>Apollo</li>
	<li>Whiskers</li>
</ol>
<h2>And just for those stressful times when you are at DBC:</h2>
